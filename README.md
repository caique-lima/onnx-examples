# ONNX examples

This repository contains a set of examples for [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/).
We bring both code to serialize a Python model to ONNX and to run inference using ONNX Runtime.

For this example we used [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) and [ONNX Runtime](https://microsoft.github.io/onnxruntime/).
But it can be applied to any other language supported by ONNX Runtime.
